# 3PRM-Workshops
A New People-Centric Approach to Determining an Organization's Exposure to a Third-Party Data Breach
 
In this data-driven workshop, we will make sense of third-party data breach risk using regression analysis.  We will show that the largest component of this risk arises simply from the sheer number of vendors that can potentially expose your company's data.  We will identify which elements of current Third-Party Risk Management (3PRM), do effectively manage this cumulative-risk and we will also analyze why questionnaires, SOC 2 reports and risk-scores, do not.
 
We will deep dive with interactive use cases that apply the People-Centric approach to real-world challenges
- Fast Pass: What is my Probability of 3P Data Breach?

By attending this talk, youâ€™ll gain a comprehensive understanding of the drivers behind third-party data breach risk and practical tools to reduce exposure while maintaining the agility and innovation that third-party partnerships bring.
 
Join us to revolutionize how your organization tackles third party risk - one data driven insight at a time.
